# API open specifications

The Office JavaScript API open specifications provide information about new JavaScript APIs that are being designed for Excel, Word, and other host applications. You can review the open specifications in [branches](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/branches/all) of the **OfficeDev/office-js-docs** GitHub repository to learn about APIs that are planned for future releases and can provide feedback about the planned API features and design by logging issues in the GitHub repository.

**Important**: Features described in the API open specifications may be in various stages of development, such as early design or public preview, and are subject to change. When an API feature becomes generally available, related documentation is removed from the open specification and added to the [Office Add-ins documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/).
