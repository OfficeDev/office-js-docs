|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Hosts:**|Access, Excel, Word|
|**Last changed in BindingEvents**|1.1|

```js
Office.EventType.BindingDataChanged
```


## Remarks

To add an event handler for the  **BindingDataChanged** event of a binding, use the [addHandlerAsync](../../reference/shared/binding.addhandlerasync.md) method of the **Binding** object. The event handler receives an argument of type [BindingDataChangedEventArgs](../../reference/shared/binding.bindingdatachangedeventargs.md).


## Example




```js
function addEventHandlerToBinding() {
    Office.select("bindings#MyBinding").addHandlerAsync(Office.EventType.BindingDataChanged, onBindingDataChanged);
}

function onBindingDataChanged(eventArgs) {
    write("Data has changed in binding: " + eventArgs.binding.id);
}

// Function that writes to a div with id='message' on the page.
function write(message){
    document.getElementById('message').innerText += message; 
}
```
