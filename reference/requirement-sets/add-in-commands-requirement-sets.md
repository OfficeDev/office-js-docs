# Add-in commands requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../../docs/overview/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Add-in commands are UI elements that extend the Office UI and start actions in your add-in. You can use add-in commands to add a button on the ribbon or an item to a context menu. For more information, see [Add-in commands for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint](../../docs/design/add-in-commands.md) and [Add-in commands for Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/add-in-commands-for-outlook).

The initial release of add-in commands doesn't have a corresponding requirement set (that is, there isn't an AddinCommands 1.0 requirement set). The following table lists the Office host applications that support the initial release version, and the build versions or number for those applications.  

| Release   |  Office 2013 for Windows | Office 2016 for Windows\*   |  Office 2016 for iPad  |  Office 2016 for Mac  | Office Online  |  
|:-----|-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Add-in commands (initial release, no requirement set) | Not applicable | Version 1603 (Build 6769.0000) or later | N/A | 15.33 or later| January 2016 | |

The add-in commands 1.1 requirement set introduces the ability to [autoopen a task pane with documents](../../docs/add-ins/design/automatically-open-a-task-pane-with-a-document).  

The following table lists the add-in commands 1.1 requirement set, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application. 

|  Requirement set  |  Office 2013 for Windows | Office 2016 for Windows\*   |  Office 2016 for iPad  |  Office 2016 for Mac  | Office Online  |  
|:-----|-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| AddinCommands 1.1  | N/A | Version 1705 (Build 8121.1000) or later | N/A | 15.34 or later| May 2017 | |

>**\*Note:** The build number for Office 2016 installed via MSI is 16.0.4266.1001. To use add-in commands, run Office update to get the latest version.
