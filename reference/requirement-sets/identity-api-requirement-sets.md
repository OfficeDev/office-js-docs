# Identity API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../../docs/overview/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Identity API requirement sets, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  | Office 2013 for Windows | Office 2016 for Windows   |  Office 2016 for iPad  |  Office 2016 for Mac  | Office Online  | SharePoint Online | OneDrive.com |Outlook.com & Exchange Online|
