# Object Load Options (JavaScript API for Visio)

Represents an object that can be passed to the load method to specify the set of properties and relations to be loaded upon execution of **sync()** method that synchronizes the states between Visio objects and corresponding JavaScript proxy objects. This takes in options such as select and expand parameters to specify a set of properties to be loaded on the object and also allows pagination on the collection.

It is also valid to supply a string containing the properties and relations to be loaded or to provide an array containing the list of properties and relations to be loaded. See the following example.

```js
object.load  ('<var1>,<relation1/var2>');

// Pass the parameter as an array.
object.load (["var1", "relation1/var2"]);
```
