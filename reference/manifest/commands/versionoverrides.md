### xmlns 
This is a required attribute which defines the schema location. The value should always be defined as `http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides`.

### xsi:type
This is a required attribute which defines the schema version. At this time the only valid value is `VersionOverridesV1_0`.  

### Description
Describes the add-in. This overrides the `Description` element in any parent portion of the manifest. The text of the description is contained in a child element of the LongString element contained in the [Resources](./resources.md) element. The `resid` attribute of the Description element is set to the value of the `id` attribute of the `String` element that contains the text.

### Requirements
Specifies the minimum requirement set and version of Office.js that the Office add-in needs to activate. It is defined the same as in [Outlook add-in manifests](../requirments.md). This overrides the  `Requirements` element in the parent portion of the manifest.

### Hosts
See [Hosts](./hosts.md).

### Resources 
See [Resources](./resources.md).
