# Word JavaScript API programming overview

The Word JavaScript APIs let you wed the flexibility of Web development with extending the most popular document editing software to create compelling add-ins for Word. The Word JavaScript APIs let you create add-ins that reside in the Word UI. You can use any server technology to host your add-in whether it be ASP.NET, NodeJS, Python, or any other web server. Use your favorite client side framework like Ember, Backbone, Angular, React, or just stick with VanillaJS to develop your solution to interact with and extend the functionality of Word. Use services like Azure for [authentication](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Nodejs-ServerAuth) and application hosting.

The Word JavaScript APIs give your application access to the objects and metadata found in a Word document. You can use these APIs to create add-ins that target:
* (Windows) Word 2013 and later
* (Web) Word Online
* (Mac) Word 2016 and later
* Word for iOS

Write your add-in once, and it will run in all versions of Word on different platforms.

## The JavaScript API options

There are two sets of JavaScript APIs that you can use to interact with the objects and metadata in a Word document. The first set of APIs were introduced with Office 2013. These APIs are considered the shared APIs as many of the objects can be used in add-ins hosted by two or more Office clients. Use the [Word](http://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/javascript-api-for-office?product=word) filter on [dev.office.com](dev.office.com) to get a view of the shared APIs that can be used by Word. This API uses callbacks extensively throughout it.

Starting with Word 2016 for both Mac and Windows, there is a new strongly-typed and Word specific JavaScript object model for creating Word add-ins. This new object model gives you access to familiar objects like [body](../../reference/word/body.md), [content controls](../../reference/word/contentcontrol.md), [inline pictures](../../reference/word/inlinepicture.md) and [paragraphs](../../reference/word/paragraph.md). This API uses promises through out it. This is the preferred API as it provides Word specific objects. We have TypeScript definitions and vsdoc files so that you can get code hints in your IDE.

As of the original publish date of this article, all of the Word clients support the shared API, and most of the clients support the Word specific JavaScript API. We are moving towards having all of the APIs available on all of the Word clients at the same time. Check the reference documentation to learn which clients are supported by the Word specific JavaScript API.

We recommend that you start with the Word specific APIs as the object model is easier to use. Use the Word specific API if you need to:
* Access the objects in the Word document.

Use the shared API when you need to:
* Target Word 2013
* Perform initial actions for the application.
* Check the supported requirement set.
* Access metadata, settings, and environmental information for the document.
* Bind to sections in a document and capture events.
* Use custom XML parts.
* Open a dialog box.

## Word JavaScript API overview

The Word 2016 add-in object model is different than the model for Word in Office 2013. The Office 2013 add-in model is not typed and provides a generic API for extending Office clients. This model is still applicable to Word 2016; however, we recommend that you start using the new Word object model.

The new Word JavaScript API changes the way that you can interact with objects like documents and paragraphs. Rather than providing individual asynchronous APIs for retrieving and updating each of these objects, the new APIs provide “proxy” JavaScript objects that correspond to the real objects running in Word. You can directly interact with these proxy objects by synchronously reading and writing their properties and calling synchronous methods to perform operations on them. These interactions with proxy objects aren’t immediately realized in the running script, so we provide a method on the context named sync(). The context.sync method synchronizes the state between your running JavaScript and the real objects in Office by executing instructions queued in your script and by retrieving properties of loaded Word objects for use in your script.

The JavaScript API for Word is loaded by Office.js. It provides a set of JavaScript proxy objects that are used to queue a set of commands that interact with the contents of a Word document. These commands are run as a batch. The results of the batch are actions taken on the Word document, like inserting content, and synchronizing the Word objects with the JavaScript proxy objects.

We make changes to this API all of the time. Learn what's new by reading our [change log](http://dev.office.com/changelog).



## Manifest

The new Word add-in JavaScript API uses the same manifest format as is used for the Office 2013 add-in model. The manifest describes where the add-in is hosted, how it is displayed, permissions, and other information. Learn more about how you can customize the [add-in manifests](../overview/add-in-manifests.md).

You have a few options for publishing Word add-in manifests. Read about how you can [publish your Office add-in](../publish/publish.md) to a network share, to an app catalog, or to the Office store.

## OpenSpec
Learn about the new Word APIs by reading our Open API specifications. We now share our pre-release, and preview API information so that you can review and provide feedback on our APIs. Read more about [OpenSpec](../../reference/openspec.md) to learn which new features are in the pipeline for the Word JavaScript APIs.
