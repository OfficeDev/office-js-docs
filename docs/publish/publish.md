# Deploy and publish your Office Add-in

You can use one of several methods to deploy your Office Add-in for testing or distribution to users.

|**Method**|**Use...**|
|:---------|:------------|
|[Sideloading](../testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins.md)|As part of your development process, to test your add-in running on Windows, Office Online, iPad, or Mac.|
|[Centralized deployment](centralized-deployment.md)|In a cloud or hybrid deployment, to distribute your add-in to users in your organization.|
|[Office Store](https://dev.office.com/officestore/docs/submit-to-the-office-store)|To distribute your add-in publicly to users.|
|[SharePoint catalog](publish-task-pane-and-content-add-ins-to-an-add-in-catalog.md)|In an on-premises environment, to distribute your add-in to users in your organization.|
|[Exchange server](#outlook-add-in-deployment)|In an on-premises or online environment, to distribute Outlook add-ins to users.|

The options that are available depend on the Office host that you're targeting and the type of add-in you create.

>**Note:** If you plan to your add-in to the Office Store, make sure that you conform to the [Office Store validation policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj220035.aspx). For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see [section 4.12](https://dev.office.com/officestore/docs/validation-policies#4-apps-and-add-ins-behave-predictably) and the [Office Add-in host and availability page](https://dev.office.com/add-in-availability)).

For information about how end users acquire, insert, and run add-ins, see [Start using your Office Add-in](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Start-using-your-Office-Add-in-82e665c4-6700-4b56-a3f3-ef5441996862?ui=en-US&rs=en-IE&ad=IE).

&#42; SharePoint catalogs do not support Office 2016 for Mac.

## Deployment options for Outlook add-ins

| Extension point     | Sideloading | Exchange server | Office Store |
|:---------|:-----------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
| Mail app | X           | X               | X            |
| Command  | X           | X               | X            |


## Centralized deployment via the Office 365 admin center 

The Office 365 admin center makes it easy for an administrator to deploy Word, Excel, and PowerPoint add-ins to users or groups within their organization. Add-ins deployed via the admin center are available to users in their Office applications right away, with no client configuration required. You can deploy internal add-ins as well as add-ins provided by ISVs via centralized deployment.

For more information, see [Use centralized deployment to publish add-ins](centralized-deployment.md).


## SharePoint catalog deployment

A SharePoint add-in catalog is a special site collection that you can create to host Word, Excel, and PowerPoint add-ins. Because SharePoint catalogs don't support new add-in features implemented in the VersionOverrides node of the manifest, including add-in commands, we recommend that you use centralized deployment via the admin center if possible. Add-in commands deployed via a SharePoint catalog open in a task pane by default.

If you are deploying add-ins in an on-premises environment, use a SharePoint catalog. For details, see [Publish task pane and content add-ins to a SharePoint catalog](publish-task-pane-and-content-add-ins-to-an-add-in-catalog.md).

> **Note:** SharePoint catalogs do not support Office 2016 for Mac. To deploy Office Add-ins to Mac clients, you must submit them to the [Office Store]. 

## Outlook add-in deployment

For on-premises and online environments that do not use the Azure AD identity service, you can deploy Outlook add-ins via the Exchange server. 

Outlook add-in deployment requires:

- Office 365, Exchange Online, or Exchange Server 2013 or later
- Outlook 2013 or later

To assign add-ins to tenants, you use the Exchange admin center to upload a manifest directly, either from a file or a URL, or add an add-in from the Office Store. To assign add-ins to individual users, you must use Exchange PowerShell. For details, see [Install or remove Outlook add-ins for your organization](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj943752(v=exchg.150).aspx) on TechNet.
