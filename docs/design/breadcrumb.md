# Breadcrumb component in Office UI Fabric

In Office Add-ins, use breadcrumbs for navigation. They show the current page’s location in a hierarchy, and help users understand where they are in relation to the rest of the hierarchy. Additionally, Breadcrumbs provide one-click navigation to higher levels in the hierarchy.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb in a task pane
