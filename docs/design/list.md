# List component in Office UI Fabric

Lists provide a consistent layout when interacting with large collections of content, even when the content is text-heavy. Lists allow users to easily scan through content. 
  
#### Example: List in a task pane

## Best Practices

- End each entry with a period if all entries are complete sentences, if:
  - One or more of the entries contains both a fragment and a complete sentence that offers additional information.
  - The entries all complete the introductory sentence or fragment.
- Separate consecutive lists on a page with a heading.


## Variants

|**Variation**|**Description**|**Example**|
|:------------|:--------------|:----------|
|**Grid List**|Use when detailed information is needed with each list item.|![Grid List image](../../images/list.png)|
