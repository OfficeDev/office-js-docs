# Word APIs - New Location

The Word preview API documentation is now hosted on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/word). That documentation set is powered by the [office-js-docs-reference](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs-reference) repo, where you can leave feedback about the Word APIs.
