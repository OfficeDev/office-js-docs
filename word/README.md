# Word JavaScript APIs

Welcome to the Word JavaScript API documentation repository. Here you'll find what you'll need to create the next generation of Word add-ins in Office 2016 for Windows (if you can't find it, open an issue). The new Word JavaScript APIs provide Word-specific functionality related to documents, paragraphs, content controls, and other common Word objects. This API complements the functionality of our existing Office.js library. 

This documentation is [published on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/mt616496.aspx). 

## Try it out

We've been working on a Snippet Explorer to let you browse through common code snippets and learn how the new APIs work. Give it a try. The code snippets referenced by the Snippet Explorer are available [here](https://officesnippetexplorer.azurewebsites.net/#/snippets/word). 

## Give feedback

We need it, you want to give it. Feedback is much easier to give now that we're on GitHub. Check out the docs and let us know about any [issues](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/issues) you find in those docs by submitting issues directly in this repository. Let us know what you think about the APIs and the general programming experience. 

We suggest you use the tags [office-js] and [word] on StackOverflow for asking questions to the community.
