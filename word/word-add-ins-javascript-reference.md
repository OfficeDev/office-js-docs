* [ContentControl](word-add-ins-javascript-reference/contentcontrol.md): A container for content. It is a bound and
 potentially labeled region in a document that serves as a container for specific types of content. For example, content 
 controls can contain contents such as paragraphs of formatted text and other content controls. You can access a 
 content control through the content control collection of the document, document body, paragraph, range, or on a content control.
* [Document](word-add-ins-javascript-reference/document.md): The top-level object. A Document object contains one or more 
[sections](word-add-ins-javascript-reference/section.md), a body that contains the content of the document, and header/footer information.
